## Business Objectives
This project analyzes Google Analytics e-commerce session data to evaluate website performance and customer behavior. 

The analysis aims to: 

* Measure key e-commerce performance metrics such as visits, pageviews, transactions, and revenue.

* Evaluate marketing channel effectiveness by analyzing traffic sources and bounce rates.

* Understand customer behavior in the purchase funnel (product view → add to cart → purchase).

* Provide data-driven insights that support optimization of marketing strategies, website experience, and revenue growth.

## Dataset
Google BigQuery Public Dataset: ```bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions```

Some fields are nested and repeated, therefore UNNEST() is used in SQL queries to extract product-level information. 

The table below summarizes the key fields used in this analysis. The complete dataset schema can be found [hear](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en).

| Field | Type | Description | 
|------|------|-------------| 
| fullVisitorId | STRING | The unique visitor ID. | 
| date | STRING | The date of the session in YYYYMMDD format. | 
| totals | RECORD | This section contains aggregate values across the session. |
| totals.bounces | INTEGER | Total bounces (for convenience). For a bounced session, the value is 1, otherwise it is null. |
| totals.hits | INTEGER | Total number of hits within the session. | 
| totals.pageviews | INTEGER | Total number of pageviews within the session. |
| totals.visits | INTEGER | The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session. |
| totals.transactions | INTEGER | Total number of ecommerce transactions within the session. | 
| trafficSource.source | STRING | The source of the traffic source. Could be the name of the search engine, the referring hostname, or a value of the utm_source URL parameter. | 
| hits | RECORD | This row and nested fields are populated for any and all types of hits. |
| hits.eCommerceAction | RECORD | This section contains all of the ecommerce hits that occurred during the session. This is a repeated field and has an entry for each hit that was collected. | 
| hits.eCommerceAction.action_type | STRING | The action type. Click through of product lists = 1, Product detail views = 2, Add product(s) to cart = 3, Remove product(s) from cart = 4, Check out = 5, Completed purchase = 6, Refund of purchase = 7, Checkout options = 8, Unknown = 0. | 
| hits.product | RECORD | This row and nested fields will be populated for each hit that contains Enhanced Ecommerce PRODUCT data. | 
| hits.product.productQuantity | INTEGER | The quantity of the product purchased. | 
| hits.product.productRevenue | INTEGER | The revenue of the product, expressed as the value passed to Analytics multiplied by 10^6 (e.g., 2.40 would be given as 2400000). |
| hits.product.productSKU | STRING | Product SKU. | 
| hits.product.v2ProductName | STRING | Product Name. |

## SQL Analysis
The project answers several key business questions using SQL in Google BigQuery. 

**1. Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month).**

```sql
SELECT 
  format_date('%Y%m',parse_date('%Y%m%d', date)) month
  ,count(totals.visits) visits
  ,sum(totals.pageviews) pageviews
  ,sum(totals.transactions) transactions 
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*` 
where _table_suffix between '0101' and '0331'   --Jan, Feb and March 2017
group by 1
order by 1;                                     --order by month
```

| month | visits | pageviews | transactions | 
|------|------|------|------| 
| 201701 | 64694 | 257708 | 713 |
| 201702 | 62192 | 233373 | 733 | 
| 201703 | 69931 | 259522 | 993 |

**2. Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (order by total_visit DESC).**

```sql
SELECT 
  trafficSource.source source
  ,count(totals.visits) totals_visits
  ,sum(totals.bounces) total_no_of_bounces
  ,round(sum(totals.bounces)*100.0/count(totals.visits),3) bounce_rate  --Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` --month:07
group by 1
order by 2 DESC;                                                        --order by total_visit DESC
```

## Insights

* Website performance improved in Q1 2017. Visits increased from 64,694 (Jan) to 69,931 (Mar) (+8.1%), while transactions grew from 713 to 993 (+39%). The much faster growth in transactions suggests an improvement in conversion performance or marketing effectiveness.

* Organic search is the primary traffic driver. Google generates the highest number of visits (38,400), highlighting SEO as the main acquisition channel. However, its higher bounce rate (51.6%) compared to direct traffic (43.3%) suggests that users arriving directly are more engaged and likely more familiar with the brand.

* Direct traffic generates the majority of revenue. In June 2017, direct traffic generated ~97,333 revenue, far exceeding Google (~18,757) and other channels. This indicates that direct visitors likely represent returning customers with stronger purchase intent.

* Purchasers navigate the website more efficiently. Purchasers viewed 94-124 pages on average, while non-purchasers viewed 316-334 pages. This suggests buyers find products more quickly, whereas non-buyers may struggle with product discovery or lack purchase intent.

* The purchase funnel became more efficient across Q1 2017. The add-to-cart rate increased from 28.47% to 37.29%, while the purchase rate rose from 8.31% to 12.64%. This indicates users were increasingly likely to progress from product view to purchase.

## Recommendations

*  Optimize SEO landing pages. Since organic search drives a large portion of traffic, improving landing page relevance, page speed, and product navigation can increase engagement and reduce bounce rates.

*  Strengthen customer retention strategies. Returning visitors tend to show stronger purchase intent. Implementing email marketing, loyalty programs, and personalized offers can encourage repeat purchases.

* Implement product recommendation strategies. Customers frequently purchase multiple items in a session. Features like “Frequently Bought Together” can increase cross-selling and average order value.

* Improve product discovery on the website. Enhancing search functionality, product categorization, and filtering options can help users find relevant products faster and reduce browsing friction.

* Continue optimizing the purchase funnel. Simplifying checkout steps, improving product page information, and testing promotional incentives can further improve conversion rates.
